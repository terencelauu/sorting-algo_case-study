# Problem 1
Allocating medical staff, equipment, and facilities optimally to provide quality healthcare services while balancing patient demand and operational efficiency is a critical resource allocation problem in healthcare management.

Propose two algorithms for scheduling healthcare professionals' shifts and assigning operating rooms based on a hospital's needs and constraints.
Given below are the list of the professional healthcare (Table 1) and operating rooms (Table 2) available for attending patients. Table 3 is a sample of patients requiring treatment. Use these datases to demonstrate your solutions. Assume any week of the year 2023/2024 for the scheduling.

Table 1: List of Healthcare Professionals and their availability
| Staff ID | Name          | Specialty        | Shift Availability        |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1        | Dr. Smith     | Cardiologist     | Monday, Wednesday, Friday |
| 2        | Dr. Johnson   | Surgeon          | Tuesday, Thursday         |
| 3        | Nurse Brown   | Anesthetist      | Monday to Friday          |
| 4        | Nurse Miller  | Pedriatric Nurse | Monday, Wednesday, Friday |
