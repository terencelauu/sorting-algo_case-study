Problem 1
Allocating medical staff, equipment, and facilities optimally to provide quality healthcare services while balancing patient demand and operational efficiency is a critical resource allocation problem in healthcare management.
Propose two algorithms for scheduling healthcare professionals' shifts and assigning operating rooms based on a hospital's needs and constraints.
Given below are the list of the professional healthcare (Table 1) and operating rooms (Table 2) available for attending patients. Table 3 is a sample of patients requiring treatment. Use these datases to demonstrate your solutions. Assume any week of the year 2023/2024 for the scheduling.
